# BIO_350_F25
Starting our BIO350 assigments repo.

IC Assingment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
• Making a difference equation
• Techanical difficulties, SHOULD be btter from now on
• It works!


IC Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook
• Making an exponential equation to measure how quickly duckeweed covers a pond
• Minimal techanical difficulties, bit better
• Works and introduced matplotlib, and plotting on x and y axis


IC_InclassExample1
• Made the log of the graph from assignment 2



IC_Assigment 3: Chapter 3 of Ecology Handbook 

• All information and values come from Chapter 3 of the Handbook of Quantitative Ecology
• This program shows how a plant population grows over time using a logistic growth model. It starts with 12 plants and applies the logistic equation each year to account for growth slowing as the population nears the carrying capacity of 400. 
• The analysis technique is a discrete-time population model.
• The program simulates plant population growth with self-shading and explicit deaths and without.

IC_InclassExample2

• Imported population data from a CSV file using pandas. 

• Plotted population size over time (days) using matplotlib, with days on the x-axis, population on the y-axis
and a horizontal reference line at y=276
 
• Calculated average population size between day 17 and day 60 to make the horizontal reference line at y=276

• This analysis uses a density-independent approach because the analysis does not include any factors or equations that account for population regulation by density. It simply summarizes and visualizes population data without modeling how population size affects growth.
