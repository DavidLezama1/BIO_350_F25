Starting our BIO350 assigments repo.

_____________________________________________________________________________

IC Assingment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook:

• Making a difference equation

• Techanical difficulties, SHOULD be btter from now on

• It works!

_____________________________________________________________________________

IC Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook:

• Making an exponential equation to measure how quickly duckeweed covers a pond

• Minimal techanical difficulties, bit better

• Works and introduced matplotlib, and plotting on x and y axis

IC_Assigment 3: Chapter 3 of Ecology Handbook:

• All information and values come from Chapter 3 of the Handbook of Quantitative Ecology

• This program shows how a plant population grows over time using a logistic growth model. It starts with 12 plants and applies the logistic equation each year to account for growth slowing as the population nears the carrying capacity of 400

• The analysis technique is a discrete-time population model

• The program simulates plant population growth with self-shading and explicit deaths and without

IC Assignment 4: Chapter 4 of Ecology Handbook:

The code shows you how two competing plant species grow and interact in the same plot using logistic growth with self-shading and competition, showing that the colonizer eventually stabilizes at 240 (carrying capacity) while the threatened species goes extinct at year 24. 

• The program sets the initial populations, carrying capacities, number of seeds produced per year, death rates,  and number of years to simulate for both species. 

• The function records the population sizes over time and I made sure to prevent any negative values.

• The simulation runs for  50 years, and the results are stored.

• The model uses a discrete-time logistic growth simulation with Lotka–Volterra competition to analyze species interactions.

IC_InclassExample1:

• Made the log of the graph from assignment 2

_____________________________________________________________________________

IC_InclassExample2:

• Imported population data from a CSV file using pandas

• Plotted population size over time (days) using matplotlib, with days on the x-axis, population on the y-axis
and a horizontal reference line at y=276
 
• Calculated average population size between day 17 and day 60 to make the horizontal reference line at y=276

• This analysis uses a density-independent approach because the analysis does not include any factors or equations that account for population regulation by density. It simply summarizes and visualizes population data without modeling how population size affects growth
