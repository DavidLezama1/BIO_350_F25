Starting our BIO350 assigments repo.

IC Assingment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
-Making a difference equation
-Techanical difficulties, SHOULD be btter from now on
-It works!


IC Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook
-Making an exponential equation to measure how quickly duckeweed covers a pond
-Minimal techanical difficulties, bit better
-Works and introduced matplotlib, and plotting on x and y axis


IC_InclassExample1
-Made the log of the graph from assignment 2



IC_Assigment 3: Chapter 3 of Ecology Handbook 

-All information and values come from Chapter 3 of the Handbook of Quantitative Ecology
-This program shows how a plant population grows over time using a logistic growth model. It starts with 12 plants and applies the logistic equation each year to account for growth slowing as the population nears the carrying capacity of 400. 
-The analysis technique is a discrete-time population model.
-The program simulates plant population growth with self-shading and explicit deaths and without.
